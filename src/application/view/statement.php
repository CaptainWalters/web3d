    <p>I state with confidence that this website and models and renders contained within are of my own design with no outside help, 
        excluding learning tools such as those provided by the University of Sussex.</p>
    <p>This site is built using core web technologies and enhanced with the use of a task runner, which allowed for faster development of the app, as well as the inclusion of sass, a css preprocessor to build simpler stylesheets, for more information click the github link below.</p>
